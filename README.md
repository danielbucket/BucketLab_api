# BucketLab API

BucketLab API is a backend service designed to manage and process data for the BucketLab application. It provides a set of RESTful endpoints to handle various operations such as user management and storage, inter-user communications.
This api can be deployed on virtually any arm64 computer with an installed Docker deamon.
It was built on a macBook, but it is live-served from an active Raspberry Pi5 deployment that houses a containerized instance of the BucketLab Empire.
Baby steps. One empirical baby-step at a time.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

#### For Development:
Create a `.env.dev` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:
```
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=your_password_for_mongoDB
MONGO_DB_USERNAME=your_username_for_mongoDB
MONGO_DB_DATABASE=bucketlab
TUNNEL_TOKEN=your_cloudflared_tunnel_token
JWT_SECRET=your_development_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

#### For Production:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:
```
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=your_production_password_for_mongoDB
MONGO_DB_USERNAME=your_production_username_for_mongoDB
MONGO_DB_DATABASE=bucketlab
TUNNEL_TOKEN=your_production_cloudflared_tunnel_token
JWT_SECRET=your_production_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
APP_RUN_MODE=production
```

### 4. Start the Application

#### Development:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d
```

#### Production:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.production.yaml up --build -d
```

### To Stop the Application:
```bash
# Development
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml down

# Production
docker compose -f compose.production.yaml down
```

## Development:
```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build -d
```

### 5. Access the API
Once the app is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:4020`.
Or by navigating to the domain that the Cloudflare Tunnel is connected to.
Example: `https://api.bucketlab.io/`

## Running Tests
To run the test suite:
```bash
